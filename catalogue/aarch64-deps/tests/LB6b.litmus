C	R1 = 1
D	conditional branch over
E	R1 = 2
over:
F	Store(R7, [R8])		// completely independent

there is an argument that the Store (F) can be made visible to other observers
before the Load (A) has returned its data, because the Store is "independent"
of the conditional branch, so the value returned by the Load (which determines
the direction of the branch) doesn't affect the operation of the Store in any
way.*)
